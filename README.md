## Getting Started

Project for integration with the NCL logistics HUB for deliveries to the Greater VitÃ³ria region.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
    - `core`: the folder to maintain main
    - `model`: the folder to maintain main
    - `utils`: the folder to maintain main
    - `helper`: the folder to maintain main
    - `controller`: the folder to maintain main

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
